# JobHopper - Overview

## Scope & Problem Statement

Many workers have limited outside options for career and wage progression outside their current occupations. The quality of outside options matter for workersâ€™ wages but limited data exists to provide guidance and training to workers on occupational mobility and outside-options (Monopsony and Outside Options. Schubert, Stansbury, and Taska. Harvard University, March 2020). The problem that we are tryingto solve is to provide better insight than standard data sets for improving occupational mobility options, improving worker wages, and improving policies related to investments and training.

## How to Install the Database and Analysis Tools

### Option 1: local machine

1. Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-378/).

2. Install [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) from `pip`:

   ```sh
   python3.7 -m pip install virtualenv

   OR on Windows

   python -m pip install virtualenv
   ```

3. Clone this repo to local:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/codeforboston/jobhopper.git
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment of Python 3.7 in the root of the local repo:

   ```sh
   cd jobhopper
   python3.7 -m virtualenv --python=3.7 venv

   OR on Windows

   cd jobhopper
   python -m virtualenv --python=3.7 venv
   ```

5. Activate venv:

   ```sh
   . ./venv/bin/activate

   OR on Windows

   ./venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

6. Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Create a personal `.env` file to include environment variables for the app:
   (Note: Don't include `.env` in commit, thus it's in `.gitignore`):

   ```sh
   SECRET_KEY='[generated key]'
   ```

   You can get your own 50 character secret key from [here](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/).

8. Create Postgres DB:

   a. Install [Postgres 12](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

   b. Start postgresql service and check if clusters are running.

   ```sh
   sudo service postgresql start
   pg_lsclusters
   ```

   If the text is green, it's working.

   c. Run `psql` through the newly created `postgres` user.

   ```sh
   sudo -i -u postgres
   psql
   ```

   d. Create a new user/role for the site to access the database to. Name it
   however you like as long as you note the username and password for putting
   it in `.env`.

   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE [user]
   SUPERUSER
   LOGIN
   PASSWORD '[password]';
   ```

   e. Create a new database for the site to access. Name it however you like
   (preferably 'jobhopperdatabase') as long as you note the name of the
   database for putting it in `.env`.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE [database name]
     WITH OWNER = [user];
   ```

   f. Exit out of `psql` and `postgres` user with the `exit` command for both
   cases.

   g. Add those information you written into the `.env` file.

   ```sh
   SECRET_KEY='[generated key]'

   DB_NAME='[database name]'
   DB_USER='[user/role name]'
   DB_PASSWORD='[password]'
   DB_HOST='127.0.0.1'  # Localhost IP
   ```

9. Migrate from `manage.py` in root.

   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

10. Now run the server via this script:

    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

11. Go to the URL `[baseurl]/jobs/api/leads/` and test out creating entries.
12. Go to the url `[baseurl]/api/v1/health` and ensure it returns json data.
13. Go to the url `[baseurl]/jobs` and ensure it returns data.

### Option 2: Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). It is recommended to install Docker Desktop, which includes Docker Compose.

2. Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following contents:

```
SECRET_KEY=[your secret, see above]
DB_USER=[your username]
DB_PASSWORD=[your password]
DB_EXTERNAL_PORT=5432
```

3. Build the Docker image by running `docker-compose build`. You will need to run this whenever the `requirements.txt` files changes.

4. Start the database and server by running `./docker-restart.sh` if you are using Mac/Linux/Git Bash. If you are using Command Prompt or PowerShell, run `docker-compose down; docker-compose up`.

You can start a shell in the Django container with `docker-compose exec api bash`, and a shell in the database container with `docker-compose exec db bash`.

To start `psql`, an interactive PostgresQL shell, open a database shell and run `psql -U [your username] -d jobhopper_dev`.
