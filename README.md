# JobHopper - README (v1)

## General Information
Jobhopper is an application for analyzing and querying career mobility and outside options data set to help workers, public sector professionals, and policymakers to improve career training, career paths, and career mobility options.

## Scope & Problem Statement
Many workers have limited outside options for career and wage progression outside their current occupations. The quality of outside options matter for workersâ€™ wages but limited data exists to provide guidance and training to workers on occupational mobility and outside-options (Monopsony and Outside Options. Schubert, Stansbury,and Taska. Harvard University, March 2020). The problem that we are tryingto solve is to provide better insight than standard data sets for improving occupational mobility options, improving worker wages, and improving policies related to investments and training.

## How to Install

1. Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-378/).
2. Install [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) from `pip`:
   ```sh
   python3.7 -m pip install virtualenv
   ```
3. Clone this repo to local:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/codeforboston/jobhopper.git
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment of Python 3.7 in the root of the local repo:
   ```sh
   cd jobhopper
   python3.7 -m virtualenv --python=3.7 venv
   ```
5. Activate venv:
   ```sh
   . ./venv/bin/activate
   ```
6. Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Questions That JobHopper Will Be Trying To Answer
- [ ] How might we enable citizens to have better information about the career paths that they could move into from their current job?
- [ ] How can citizens weigh and negotiate options for a new career path?
- [ ] How might we equip policymakers with labor market data?
- [ ] How might we identify where the labor market is headed and what skills and abilities are needed in the new jobs?
- [ ] How might we equip workforce development systems with job transfer data to understand regional trends in employee movements?
1. occupational trends in their national, regional, or local labor market
2. what skills and abilities their area has, and what it might need in the future
3. how their local labor market might respond to positive or negative shocks
